# lcc

This is the source code of *A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation*. It's a completely implementation for C languange named lcc.

I modified some code to make it can be compiled on windows and also write a cmakelists with reference on makefile.nt. If you want to generate the solution, just run build.bat, but the directory build must be created first.

I am not sure whether lburg need to be regenerate or not, it is used to generate backend code. Attention here, only 32bits lburg can generate backend code. I also write a cmakelists for lburg, named lburg_CMakeLists.txt.
